## Introduction

MT Code is a free, open-source desktop app for running and controlling coding agents — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode, and Google Antigravity — from one place. It is [Munim Technologies](https://munimtech.com)' fork of [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) with extra features and fixes, and anyone can download and use it.

## Download

**[munimtech.com/mtcode](https://munimtech.com/mtcode)** — or grab installers straight from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/munimtechnologies/mtcode/releases):

- **macOS** (Apple Silicon): `MT-Code-<version>-arm64.dmg`
- **Windows** (x64): `MT-Code-<version>-x64.exe`
- **Linux** (x64): `MT-Code-<version>-x86_64.AppImage`, or `MT-Code-<version>-amd64.deb` for Debian and Ubuntu

macOS builds are signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple, so they open without a Gatekeeper warning. Windows builds are unsigned: if SmartScreen warns, choose **More info → Run anyway**.

On Linux, install the `.deb` with `sudo apt install ./MT-Code-*-amd64.deb`, or make the AppImage executable (`chmod +x`) and run it.

The app auto-updates from this repository, so you get new MT Code features and fixes as they ship.

### Use it from a browser or phone

MT Code has no hosted web app of its own. Run the desktop app (or `npx t3@latest`) on your machine and reach it from another device over T3 Connect or your own HTTPS tunnel (Tailscale Serve works well); see [remote access](./docs/user/remote-access.md).

## Before you start

MT Code drives agents you already have. Install and sign in to at least one provider CLI:

- Claude: install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and run `claude`
- Codex: install [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) and run `codex login`
- Cursor: install [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli) and run `agent login`
- Grok Build: install [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli) and run `grok login`
- OpenCode: install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and run `opencode auth login`
- Antigravity: enable it in Settings, then use **Install Antigravity** and **Sign in with Google**. No CLI is required.

Your existing subscriptions are used directly — MT Code sells nothing and adds no accounts of its own.

Same cost model as T3 Code: the app and its server run on your computer, and model tokens come from Claude / Codex / Cursor / Grok / OpenCode. Munim hosts nothing on your behalf — pairing and Computer Use reach your machine directly. There is no Munim-hosted web app, no model proxy, no Workers AI classifier, and no PlanetScale relay unless you explicitly opt into that paid stack.

## MT Code vs T3 Code

Compared to [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code). MT Code started as a fork. Upstream is merged only when you ask an agent to do it — nothing pulls `pingdotgg/t3code` automatically. Some rows started as unmerged upstream PRs that MT Code ships today; others were built here.

This table lists only the differences, roughly in the order of how much they change the app. When T3 Code ships something MT Code had first, MT Code adopts T3 Code's version and drops the row. Recent examples: thread-to-thread messaging, scheduled sends, provider handoff and resume on restart. Apart from the rows T3 Code wins at the bottom, nothing T3 Code ships is missing here.

| **Mobile app** — MT Code has no app of its own; T3 Code's app pairs with an MT Code desktop and works with it                                                                                                |   ❌    | ✅ [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/t3-code-remote-claude-more/id6787819824) · [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.t3tools.t3code) |
| **Hosted web app** — MT Code's own was retired; use T3 Connect or your own tunnel instead                                                                                                                    |   ❌    |                                                            ✅ [app.t3.codes](https://app.t3.codes)                                                            |

Everything else T3 Code does — multi-provider agent control, checkpoints and diffs, remote access from T3 Code's [web](https://app.t3.codes) and mobile apps, Connect tunnels — works here too.

## Relationship to upstream

MT Code does not auto-merge [pingdotgg/t3code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code). Upstream lands only when you explicitly ask an agent to merge it. Features built here are offered upstream as PRs when they fit; some MT Code features started as unmerged upstream PRs we adopted. Bug reports about MT Code builds belong on [this repo's issues](https://github.com/munimtechnologies/mtcode/issues) — please don't file MT Code problems upstream.

MT Code exists because T3 Code is truly open. Credit and thanks to the T3 team.

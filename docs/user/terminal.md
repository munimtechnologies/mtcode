# Terminal

## External terminal apps

In the desktop app, choose **Settings → Integrations → Terminal app**, then open
the chat’s **Open** dropdown and select the action under **Terminal**. It opens
the current project or worktree directory in your selected app. Install that
terminal app on the machine running T3 Code desktop. Selecting Terminal or iTerm2
on macOS requests Automation permission before saving your choice. If you deny
access, enable it in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation** and
select the terminal again.

For remote environments, the terminal connects over SSH and changes to that
directory. It uses your local SSH configuration and credentials; a T3 Code
connection alone does not grant SSH access. Environments without an advertised
SSH host or configured SSH alias cannot use this action.

## Terminal history

Each terminal keeps up to 5,000 lines and 8 MiB of scrollback on its environment
server. T3 Code removes the oldest output when either limit is reached. A long
line can be shortened at the start. New terminal output is not truncated.

These limits apply when you reconnect and when T3 Code restores saved terminal
history. A client can show less scrollback than the server keeps.

On web and desktop, use Shift+PageUp and Shift+PageDown to read scrollback
without leaving terminal input. Ctrl+Shift+Home and Ctrl+Shift+End jump to the
start and latest output; use Cmd instead of Ctrl on macOS. Full-screen terminal
programs keep these navigation keys.

To copy all retained output, choose Select all in the terminal's context menu,
then copy. Cmd+A on macOS and Ctrl+Shift+A elsewhere select the same output.
Ctrl+A still moves to the beginning of shell input on Windows and Linux.
Jump to latest in the context menu returns to the current output.

# Find in the terminal

With a terminal focused, press `mod+f` to search its output and scrollback.
`mod` is Command on macOS and Ctrl on Windows and Linux; `Ctrl+Shift+F` also
works, or click the search icon next to the terminal buttons. Enter moves to
the next match and Shift+Enter to the previous one. Use the toggle for
case-sensitive search, and Escape to close. Rebind **Terminal: Find** in
Settings → Keybindings.

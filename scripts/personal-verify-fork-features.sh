# Verify the MT Code fork's custom features are still WIRED, not just present.
#
# Why this exists: upstream merges into this fork have repeatedly kept a
# feature's modules, types, and tests while dropping the few lines that CALL
# them. Typecheck stays clean, unit tests stay green, and the feature is
# silently gone from the app (this happened to Goals, the usage "All" window,
# the composer /goal menu, the # thread-reference chip, and the web dictation
# mic). Each check below pins a feature's
# call-site — the line a merge is most likely to lose — not its module.
#
# Run it:
#   - after EVERY upstream merge, before pushing to fork/main
#   - personal-refresh-all.sh runs it before building; a failure aborts the
#     fleet refresh so a broken merge never ships to Mac/Blade/Dell
#
# When a check fails after a merge: the merge dropped that feature's wiring.
# Restore the call site (git log -S the pattern to find the last-good commit),
# do not delete the check. Only remove a check when Sheehan explicitly retires
# the feature.
